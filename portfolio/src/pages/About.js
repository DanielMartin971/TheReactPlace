            <p>My name is Daniel, I love to code! Doing lots of critical thinking and planning! I got into this industry from gaming</p>
            <p>I always wanted to make games; from there I found software engineering and a love for making websites instead!</p>
            <p>I've still made a few games just for fun and show getting myself orientated well with Javascript</p>
